This project was created for COMP 6600 - Artifical Intelligence, and seeks to aid a realistic setting where Steel Mill workers would need to access information about various tools or machines in an enviroment where internet connection is tenuous.
Thus, we created a Python notebook that sets up a system for recognizing and intepreting user input before giving pre-programmed responses. 
This repository contains our final notebook, as well as our report and data for the experiment.
